          It's time to gather your community and bring everyone together.
          Whether it's a space to connect with your users, a hobby group, a
          course group for collaborative learning, or a place for like-minded
          folks to bond over shared interests, you name it! Your community, your
          rules.
          <br />
          <br />
          We understand that it can be really overwhelming to start, so we have
          simplified it all for you. Itâ€™ll just take a couple of minutes for you
          to get started.
        </p>
